A small script that queries a NASA web service to get a list of near earth asteroids for today, filters some information and writes the list to a csv file.

The NASA web service is called NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service). NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information.
